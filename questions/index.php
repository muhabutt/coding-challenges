	<h3><a href="question1/laravel/public">QUESTION #1</a></h3>
	<pre>
		This practical test has been designed to enable the candidate in demonstrating the following technical skills:
		1. The candidates knowledge of GitHub
		2. The ability to use Composer in the installation of Laravel
		3. To demostrate a basic level of knowledge of the Laravel 5 framework
		4. Your analytical and problem solving abilities.
		Task:
		1. Install a new Laravel 5.* project
		2. Create a screen with the following form fields:
			a. input field - should be mandatory and accept only an integer value from 1 to 100
			b. submit button
		3. When the form is submitted:
			a. An array should be created which holds values from 1 to 100, however the value that has been entered by the
			user should be omitted
			b. Without prior knowledge of what number was submitted by the user, a function should be written to return the
			missing number from the array
			c. Display the missing number to the screen

		We would like to see how well you can implement bootstrap & JavaScript.

		You are not required to use MySQL/MariaDB to solve the problem, we leave it up to you.

		Although not timed, We estimate that the test should run for no more than 2 hours.

		4. Please provide installation instructions on how to get the project up and running -
		these can be bullet pointed, no essays are required!
		5. Once completed, please upload your work to GitHub and invite moin@appsumer.io to the repository.
		If you do not have a github account, please send the completed work to the same email address.

	<h3><a href="question2/question2.html">QUESTION #2</a></h3>
	<pre>
	  You have as an input an array which contains unsorted words.Provide a solution for implementing hasWord(word)
	  which receives a word and returns true if it is in the array and false otherwise.
	  You are not allowed to use JS Objects (maps) in your solution but can use Arrays.
	  Solution time complexity is more important then it’s space complexity.
	  </pre>

	<h3><a href="question3/question3.php">QUESTION #3</a></h3>
	<pre>
	  Given a string of words, return the most common used word in it.
	</pre>

	<h3><a href="question4/index.html">QUESTION #4</a></h3>
	<pre>
		Write 2 functions, which receive an array of functions as an input,
		and notify using a promise, when they are all complete.
		Each of the input functions returns a promise and resolves it when done.
		Your first function should execute all the functions in the input array,
		without any importance for their order,
		and the second one should execute each after the previous ended.
		Both should notify its caller using a promise when they are done.
	</pre>

	<h3><a href="question5/index.php">QUESTION #5</a></h3>
	<pre>
	  Implement preceding value in a LinkedList —
	  This function receives a value and returns the preceding value in the link list.
	</pre>
